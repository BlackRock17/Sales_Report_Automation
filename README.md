# Automated Sales Report Generator

This project is a Python-based automated sales report generator. It demonstrates key data engineering skills including data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and report generation.

## Features

- Generates sample sales data
- Performs basic sales analysis
- Creates visualizations of sales data
- Generates an HTML report with analysis results and visualizations

## Project Structure

- `data_generation.py`: Generates sample sales data
- `data_analysis.py`: Performs basic analysis on the sales data
- `visualizations.py`: Creates visualizations based on the analyzed data
- `report_generation.py`: Generates an HTML report
- `main.py`: Orchestrates the entire process

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Usage

Run `main.py` to generate the sales report. The script will create several PNG files for visualizations and an HTML file (`sales_report.html`) containing the full report.

This project serves as a foundation for more complex data engineering tasks and can be extended with additional analyses, data sources, or automation features.
